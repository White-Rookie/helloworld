git log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit#cat branch merged status
git push origin branch name
git pull #no tracking information---git branch --set-upstream-to <branch-name> origin/<branch-name>
git pull origin master --allow-unrelate-histories
###when you merge two branch, there maybe some conflicts,after you have corrected the mistakes,the last step you should do is "git commit"
git reflog ##historic instructions
git log ##get history information and decide which commit-id you want to go
git reset --hard commit-id##head^ or head^^
State:1-modified  2-untracked files  3-new or deleted  4-commit

1.work zone---->2.temporary storage area------>submission
           git add *****  ******      git commit

git checkout -- <filename>  #give up modified work in the work zone
the most important is the sign of "--",without it there will be a different meanning

when you have add the file, before you commit, you can use ---git reset HEAD <file> transit the modified content from storage area to work area
